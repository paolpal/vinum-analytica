# Wine Review Mining

This project is a part of the DMML (Data Mining and Machine Learning) course at th University of Pisa. The main objective of this project is to classify the variety of grapes based on the description of the wine.

## Project Overview
In this project, we will be working with a dataset of wine reviews. The dataset contains various attributes such as the description of the wine, its country of origin, winery, and more. Our goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the variety of grapes based on the given description.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [source name]. It consists of a large collection of wine reviews, each containing information about the wine's characteristics and a textual description. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure the quality of the data.

## Methodology
To achieve our goal, we will follow a step-by-step approach:

1. Data Preprocessing: We will perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. Feature Extraction: We will extract relevant features from the textual descriptions using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
3. Model Training: We will train various machine learning models, such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Network, to classify the variety of grapes.
4. Model Evaluation: We will evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics and select the best-performing model.
5. Model Deployment: Once we have a reliable model, we will deploy it to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## Results
The results of this project will be presented in the form of accuracy scores and confusion matrices, showcasing the performance of the trained models. We aim to achieve high accuracy in classifying the variety of grapes based on the wine descriptions.

## Usage
To use this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the main script to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.
4. Use the trained model to make predictions on new wine descriptions.

## Conclusion
By successfully classifying the variety of grapes based on the wine descriptions, this project aims to contribute to the field of wine analysis and provide insights for wine enthusiasts, sommeliers, and winemakers.
