    This report presents a data mining project 
    that analyzes the language used in wine reviews 
    written by sommeliers. We compare the performance 
    of three different models: 
    Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Network. 
    The analysis includes a detailed examination of 
    preprocessing techniques, class contamination 
    removal, and feature vectorization using TF-IDF. 
    We assess the models based on their accuracy 
    and present the results through various evaluations.
