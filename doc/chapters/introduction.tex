\section{Introduction} 
The growing availability of online wine reviews offers a valuable resource for understanding the language used to describe different wine varieties. This study aims to analyze the vocabulary employed in these reviews to classify wines based on the grape variety being reviewed. By examining the textual features of the reviews, we seek to uncover linguistic patterns that correlate with specific grape varieties. Three machine learning models—Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Network—are utilized to explore and classify the relationship between the language used and the wine variety.
